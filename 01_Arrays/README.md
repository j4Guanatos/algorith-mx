### Problem #1

You have an unsorted integer array which contains numbers from 1 to n but one number is missing.
Write a program (or pseudo-code) to find that missing number.

#### Example

Input:

`{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}`

Output:

`7`


### Problem #2

Given an unsorted array of numbers, j and k, you need to find the jst smallest and the kst largest numbers in the array. 

#### Example

Input:

```
{1, 3, 7, 9, 4}, j=2, k = 3
```

Output:

```
jst smaller number (j=2) is: 3
kst greater number (k=3) is: 4
```
