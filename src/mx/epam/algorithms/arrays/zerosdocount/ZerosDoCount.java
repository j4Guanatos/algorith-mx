 * Having an arrays of numbers, place all zeros to the left of the array (if any).
 * The operation must preserve the existing relative order between the numbers.

 * Extra:
 * An objective of this problem is to solve it in-line and in O(1N).
 * This is, without any extra arrays and in a single iteration (only one for).
 * Otherwise, give a demonstration that this is not possible.
