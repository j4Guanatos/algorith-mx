# Algorith-MX

EPAM Mexico Algorithms study group.

### How it works

* We have defined a learning path combining some books (listed at the bottom) to follow.
* Every Monday, a problem will be presented, according to the next topic listed in the learning path.
* A volunteer will be the owner of the topic, and will be responsible of defining the problem and the theoretical background.
* Developers will have the whole week to study the topic and to solve the problem with the most optimal solution.
* As a Developer, you should create your own branch from master repository `$ git checkout -b <my-branch-name>`
* Use your branch to commit your solutions, in the format/language you prefer.
* Next week, the topic owner will present the most optimal solution and the link between problem and theory.
* Any of the participants can present better/innovative solution, but as requisite it needs to be pushed into participant branch.
* An assigned moderator per week will help to have smooth conversation and topic discussions.
* After this, a new set topic will be presented according to the learning path.

### Setting up the problems and updating the branch

Each topic will have the following convention: `##_<Topic>`, having ## = topic number.

Example: `00_BigO` for Big(O) Notation.

Inside the topic folder, on master branch the following files will be placed:

* A markdown file (.md) containing the problem instructions, called README.md.
* A set of .in and .out files, containing sample test cases (optional).
* A markdown file containing some of the theoretical background (optional).

To update the branch, with the new problems, use: `$ git rebase -p origin/master`

### Programming Languages

Participants are free to use the programming language they want.
